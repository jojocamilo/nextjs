The key is understanding the flex container and flex items relationship.</p><code>.container {\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: space-between;\n  align-items: center;\n  gap: 1rem;\n}\n\n.item {\n  flex: 1 1 auto; /* grow, shrink, basis */\n}</code><p>Use flexbox for components that need to distribute space dynamically, such as responsive navigation menus, card layouts, and form controls.</p>"
